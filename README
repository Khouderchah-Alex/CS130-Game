This project builds a simple game on top of an Entity System, implemented as a system to work for any game of small to medium scale.

The file GENERAL.todo contains the most important changes to be made, ranking the needed changes from Priority 1 (absolutely essential) and working its way down to Priority 3. While GENERAL.todo will not contain all of the "TODOs" in the codebase, it will contain those that demand immediate attention.

The folder structure is designed as such:
	/src - contains the entire code-base
		/src/base - "Base" code, that is, code that the game system relies on but is not necessarily related to the game system itself (data structures, functions/typedefs for platform independance, etc)
		/src/system - the code for the base game system (Entity/Component managers, base Systems, memory manangers, resource managers, etc)
		/src/game - code that builds the actual game on top of the game system (specific Components, Systems, etc)
		/src/external - code from APIs, libraries, etc
	/content - parent folder for specific asset sub-folders
		/content/audio - folder for sound files
		/content/textures - folder for texture files
