/**
 * @brief Takes input from SFML, "converts" it to events, and sends
 * the events out to ObserverComponents.
 *
 * Multiple systems can be created to handle different types of events (since
 * registered Observers will get every event from an EventSystem, regardless of
 * their relevance).
 *
 * ObserverComponents will register themselves with this system, and will
 * then be able to react to game events until unregistering themselves.
 *
 * @note Unlike other systems, the EventSystem handles the registering of
 * the ObserverComponent itself rather than using a ComponentManager. The reason
 * for this is that the ComponentManager works at the level of "these entities have
 * these components", while the EventSystem is concerned instead with which components
 * to notify. Note that the separation of different EventSystems for different types
 * of events would not work well if we simply took every observer from the component
 * manager.
