/**
 * @brief Component to add event listening to an entity.
 *
 * Takes inspiration from the Observer design pattern.
 * Maps Events to Actions (one action per event)
 * such that entities can respond to events sent out by the EventSystem.
 *
 * @note The current implementation only allows an ObserverComponent one
 * EventSystem to observe. This could easily be changed later, but take note
 * that this is the case.
 *
 * @todo Activate() is an ugly workaround of the fact that the EventSystem
 * stores ObserverComponent*s, while the ComponentManager passes around component
 * rvalues. Thus if we give the EventSystem "this" on construction, then the pointer
 * will no longer be valid after the ComponentManager finishes moving the component.
