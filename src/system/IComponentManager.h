 * generated at compile-time, this base class makes it easy to
 * hold a list of what component managers exist.
 *
 * Although all ComponentManagers have the same basic interface,
 * placing a function in the IComponentManager prevents it
 * from being static. Thus, only functions that must be applied to a
 * ComponentManager<T> of unknown T at compile-time should be placed here.
