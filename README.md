# tetrad-game
A simple game built on top of a custom-built Entity System. The ES itself is designed to work for any game of small to medium scale.
***

#### Progress
###### Current Progress
- [x] Build Entity System (Entities, Components, and their manangers)
    - [x] Implement Component and Entity Managers
- [ ] Build Game System using SFML and the Entity System
    - [ ] Build basic interface with SFML
    - [ ] Create the needed Components and Systems for audio, graphics, input, etc
    - [ ] Create a logging system
- [ ] Build the actual game
    - [ ] Create the needed Components and Systems for game-specific functionality
    - [x] Create the visual assets (mainly textures)
    - [ ] Create the audio assets
- [ ] Refine
    - [ ] Visual tweaking
    - [ ] Performance tune-up

> Note: This is a rough estimate of what needs to be done. The actual development process will not be nearly so rigidly divided between the different elements of the project. As the project progresses and profiling brings more insight, the Entity and Game systems may have to be modified to improve performance/flexibility.

###### Changes to be made
The file GENERAL.todo contains the most important changes (or "todo"s) to be made, ranking the needed changes from Priority 1 (absolutely essential) to Priority 5 (would be nice to implement). While GENERAL.todo will not contain all the work to be done in the codebase, it will contain those that demand the most attention

#### Folder Structure
* /src - contains all the source code used in the project
    * /src/base - code that the game system relies on, but is not necessarily related to the system itself (data structures, functions/typedes for platorm independence, etc)
    * /src/system - code for the game system (Entity/Component managers, memory/resource managers, etc)
    * /src/game - code that builds the actual game on top of the game system (child Components, Systems, etc)
    * /src/external - code from APIs, libraries, etc
* /assets - parent folder for specific asset sub-folders
    * /assets/audio - folder for sound files
	* /assets/fonts - folder for font files
    * /assets/textures - folder for texture files
