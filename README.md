# tetrad-game
A simple game built on top of a custom-built Entity System. The ES itself is designed to work for any game of small to medium scale.
***

#### Progress
###### Current Progress
- [x] Build Entity System (Entities, Components, and their manangers)
    - [x] Implement Component and Entity Managers
- [ ] Build Game System
    - [x] Build basic interface with GLFW
    - [ ] Create the needed Components and Systems for audio, graphics, input, etc
	    -[ ] Build the Draw System using OpenGL for rendering
    - [ ] Create a logging system
- [ ] Build the actual game
    - [ ] Create the needed Components and Systems for game-specific functionality
    - [x] Create the visual assets (mainly textures)
    - [ ] Create the audio assets
- [ ] Refine
    - [ ] Visual tweaking
    - [ ] Performance tune-up

> Note: This is a rough estimate of what needs to be done. The actual development process will not be nearly so rigidly divided between the different elements of the project. As the project progresses and profiling brings more insight, the Entity and Game systems may have to be modified to improve performance/flexibility.

###### Changes to be made
The file GENERAL.todo contains the most important changes (or "todo"s) to be made, ranking the needed changes from Priority 1 (absolutely essential) to Priority 5 (would be nice to implement). While GENERAL.todo will not contain all the work to be done in the codebase, it will contain those that demand the most attention.

#### Notes of interest
- Due to the way that static initialization works in C++, the log system can't be reliably used for any set-up that happens before the execution of main() (take, for example, the adding of ComponentManagers to EntityManager::s_pComponentManagers). Try to avoid static initialization, opting instead to use an Initialize() method to set-up classes and such.

#### Folder Structure
* /src - contains all the source code used in the project
    * /src/core - code that the game system relies on, but is not necessarily related to the system itself (data structures, functions/typedefs for platorm independence, etc)
    * /src/engie - code for the game system (Entity/Component managers, memory/resource managers, etc)
    * /src/game - code that builds on top of the base engine (most importantly, provides the systems and components for the engine)
    * /src/external - code from APIs, libraries, etc
* /assets - parent folder for specific asset sub-folders
    * /assets/audio - folder for sound files
	* /assets/fonts - folder for font files
	* /assets/shaders - folder for glsl shader files
    * /assets/textures - folder for texture files
